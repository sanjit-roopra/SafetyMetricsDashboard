**Design Brief: FSN KPI Dashboard**

### **Objective**

Develop a KPI dashboard to track Field Safety Notices (FSNs) over companies and products based on JSON data. The dashboard should provide insights through visualizations and searchable tables, allowing deep dives into company and product trends.

### **Data Structure**

Each FSN entry follows this JSON format (JSON is attached):

```json
 {
        "product": "ORBIS Medication",
        "company": "DH Healthcare GmbH",
        "date": "2025-02-11",
        "title": "Dringende Sicherheitsinformation zu ORBIS Medication von DH Healthcare GmbH",
        "category": "Medizinische Datenverarbeitung (Software) - Sonstiges",
        "reference_number": "04401/25",
        "link": "https://www.bfarm.de/SharedDocs/Kundeninfos/DE/09/2025/04401-25_kundeninfo_de.pdf?__blob=publicationFile"
    }

```
